# Getting Started
			 
This document is aimed to create and run an ASP.NET Zero based project in just 5 minutes. It's assumed that you already [purchased](/Prices) and created your ASP.NET Zero account.

## Login

[Login](https://aspnetzero.com/Account/Login) to this web site with your user name and password. Then you will see [Download](https://aspnetzero.com/Download) link on the main menu.

## Prerequirements

MVC application needs the following tools to be installed:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6.9+ with npm 3.10+
- [gulp (must be installed globally)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Bundler & Minifier Visual Studio extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9ec27da7-e24b-4d56-8064-fd7e88ac1c40)
- [Web Compiler Visual Studio extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3b329021-cd7a-4a01-86fc-714c2d05bb6c)

## Create a Project

Go to the [download](https://aspnetzero.com/Download) page. You will see a form as shown below:

<img src="images/download-core-jquery-2.png" alt="Create project" class="img-thumbnail" />

Select **ASP.NET Core & jQuery** as Project Type and fill other required fields. Click to the Download button, your project will be ready in one minute.

## Configure The Project

Before opening the solution open a command prompt, navigate to root directory of **\*.Web.Mvc** project and run "**yarn**" command to install client side dependencies.

**Important Notice:** Installing client side npm dependencies using **yarn** before opening the solution will decrease project opening & building time dramatically.

Open the **\*.Web.sln** solution in **Visual Studio 2017+**:

If you want to work on only Xamarin project, open **\*.Mobile.sln** solution. If you want to work on both Xamarin and Web projects, open **\*.All.sln** solution.

<img src="images/solution-overall-core-5.png" alt="ASP.NET Core solution" class="img-thumbnail" />

Right click the **.Web.Mvc** project and select "**Set as StartUp project**": Then **build** the solution. It make take longer time in first build since all **nuget** packages will be restored.

### Database Connection

Open **appsettings.json** in **.Web.Mvc** project and change the **Default** connection string if you want:

    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "Default": "Server=localhost; Database=PhoneBookDemoDb; Trusted_Connection=True;"
    }

### Database Migrations

We have two options to create and migrate database to the latest version.

#### ASP.NET Zero Migrator Application

ASP.NET Zero solution includes a **.Migrator** (like Acme.PhoneBookDemo.Migrator) project in the solution. You can run this tool for database migrations on development and production (see [development guide](Development-Guide-Core.md) for more information).

#### Entity Framework Migration Command

You can also use Entity Framework's built-in tools for migrations. Open **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio, set **EntityFrameworkCore** as the **Default Project** and run the **Update-Database** command as shown below:Â 

<img src="images/update-database-ef-core.png" alt="dotnet ef database update" class="img-thumbnail" />

This command will create your database and fill initial data. You can open SQL Server Management Studio to check if database is created:

<img src="images/created-database-tables-4.png" alt="ASP.NET Zero Database Tables" class="img-thumbnail" />

You can use EF console commands for development and Migrator.exe for production. But notice that; Migrator.exe supports running migrations in multiple databases at once, which is very useful in development/production for multi tenant applications.

### Multi-Tenancy

ASP.NET Zero supports multi-tenant and single-tenant applications. Multi-tenancy is **enabled by default**. If you don't have idea about multi-tenancy or don't want to create a multi-tenant application, you can **disable** it by setting **AbpZeroTemplateConsts.MultiTenancyEnabled** to false in the *.Core.Shared project.

## Run The Project

Before running the project, we need to run a npm task to bundle and minify the CSS and JavaScript files. In order to do that, we can open a command prompt, navigate to root directory of ***.Web.Mvc** project and run **npm run create-bundles** command. This command should be run when a new npm package is being added to the solution. Or you can just build your solution and all bundles will be updated automatically.

Now we are ready.. just run your solution. It will open login page of your web site.

<img src="images/login-screen-3.png" alt="Login page" class="img-thumbnail" />

If multi-tenancy is enabled, you will see the current tenant and a change link. If so, click to Change and enter **default** as tenant name. If you leave it empty, you login as the host admin user. Then enter **admin** as user name and **123qwe** as password. You should change password at first login. You will see the following dashboard page after logging in to the application.

## ASP.NET Zero Power Tools

To minimize the effort of creating a new entity, you can install the Rapid Application Development Tool from the following link:
